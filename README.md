# 💰 Secret Auction – Python Project

A simple command-line auction program where multiple participants can place secret bids, and the highest bidder wins.  
Developed as part of Day 9 of the **"100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp"** by [Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/).

## 📌 Description

The **Secret Auction** game allows multiple players to enter their bids without knowing what others have offered.  
After all participants have placed their bids, the program determines and displays the winner with the highest bid.

This project was designed to practice Python dictionaries, loops, and basic control flow.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- Python 3

## 💡 Features

- Accepts multiple bids in a single run
- Clears the console after each player's bid (to keep them secret)
- Uses a dictionary to store player names and bid amounts
- Automatically determines the highest bid and declares the winner

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. In your terminal, navigate to the project folder and run:

```bash
python main.py
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to enter player names and bids.

## 📚 What I Learned

Through this project, I practiced:

- Working with dictionaries to store and retrieve data

- Loops for continuous input

- Conditional logic to determine a winner
